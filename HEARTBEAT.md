## Tasks

### Git: Commit & Push
If there are uncommitted changes in the workspace, commit them with a descriptive message and push to origin.
- Check: `git status --porcelain`
- If output is non-empty: stage all, commit, push
- Keep commit messages concise but descriptive
- Don't commit if only lock files or temp files changed

### Watch: Claude Sonnet 5 Release
Check if Anthropic has officially announced Claude Sonnet 5.
- Search for official Anthropic announcement (not just leaks/rumors)
- If officially released: notify Anders immediately, then remove this task
- Check once per heartbeat until released
