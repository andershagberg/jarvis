## Major Discovery: Cron Job Delivery Bug

### The Bug
- Jobs with `delivery.channel: "signal"` fail with error "Unsupported channel: whatsapp"
- The job config is correct, but somewhere in the delivery mechanism, "whatsapp" is used instead
- Subagent never calls message tool — error comes from cron delivery system itself

### The Workaround
- Using `delivery.channel: "last"` instead of `"signal"` **works**
- Also changed `wakeMode: "now"` (instead of `"next-heartbeat"`)
- `at` schedules work fine; `cron` expression schedules were skipping silently (separate issue)

### Related GitHub Issues
- #2217: Cron jobs skipped when HEARTBEAT.md is empty (different but related)
- PR #3335: Fixes for cron jobs

## TTS Voice Configuration

- **Swedish:** `sv-SE-MattiasNeural` (Edge TTS) — set as default
- **English:** `en-GB-RyanNeural`
- Config updated to use Mattias for Swedish voice messages
- Voice messages must be sent via `message` tool with `asVoice: true`, not MEDIA: directive
